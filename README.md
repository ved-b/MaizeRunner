Peer Testing:
During peer-testing with friends they often got lost while playing the game since the camera is very zoomed in. Therefore, we added a zoom-out feature to ensure players always know where they are in the map.

We also found that players that the old music got annoying since it would repeat on loop after 30 seconds. Given this feedback, we found a more suitable, calming music choice.
